### Notes ####

in func-public - might want to pull miannet prices to use in testnet bot (part 32, 12 & 18 mins)


updated spread calculation does not work and causes error - check back when bot functions



#### Current issues ####

unable to place some trades - possibly slippage tolerance / accounting for coins in multiples 

Perhaps try out some of the caht GPT examples in a blank file ?
